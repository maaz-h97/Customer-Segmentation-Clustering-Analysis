# Customer-Segmentation-Clustering-Analysis
Customer segmentation using K-Means clustering to identify distinct customer groups based on age, income, and spending behavior, with Tableau dashboard visualization.

## Overview

This project applies K-Means clustering to segment customers based on demographic and behavioral data.  
The analysis helps businesses identify distinct customer profiles to enable targeted marketing strategies.  
An interactive Tableau dashboard visualizes the segmentation results for easy exploration.
